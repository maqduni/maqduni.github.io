My name is Iskandar Rafiev, I am a full-stack software engineer with 9 years of professional experience in different fields and with different technologies. I am very interested in clean and scalable architectural solutions for front-end and back-end applications.

My latest passion has been my pet project, a Tajik Persian explanatory online dictionary [Vazhaju (Вожаҷӯ / واژه‌جو)][1], which I designed and developed from scratch. It incorporated a lot of my ideas and approaches, some of which I share here in my blog.

If you are interested in my work, visit my GitHub page or shoot me a message on LinkedIn.
